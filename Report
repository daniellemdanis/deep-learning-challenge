**Overview of the Analysis:**
The analysis aims to develop a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to 
predict the success of Alphabet Soup-funded organizations based on input features in the dataset. 
The model targets a predictive accuracy higher than 75%.

**Results:**

**Data Preprocessing:**
- **Target Variable(s):** "IS_SUCCESSFUL" indicates organization success.
- **Feature Variable(s):** All columns except "IS_SUCCESSFUL".
- **Variables Removed:** "EIN" and "NAME" for lack of relevance.

**Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:**
- **Neurons, Layers, and Activation Functions:** Two hidden layers with 128 and 64 neurons, ReLU activation for hidden layers, and sigmoid for the output layer.
- **Target Model Performance:** Achieved predictive accuracy higher than 75%.
- **Steps to Increase Model Performance:** Optimized data by dropping irrelevant columns, binning rare occurrences, 
and scaling features. Enhanced model architecture by adding neurons, layers, and experimenting with activation functions.

**Summary:**
Overall, the deep learning model developed for Alphabet Soup performed effectively, 
achieving the target predictive accuracy of higher than 75%. To further improve model performance, 
additional techniques such as feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and ensemble methods could be explored. 
Alternatively, a different model such as a gradient boosting algorithm could be considered for this classification problem. 
These algorithms often perform well with tabular data and provide interpretability, 
making them suitable candidates for solving the classification problem at hand.
